# Binary Semaphore

Marketing and portfolio site for **Binary Semaphore**, a small software team
working across applied AI, distributed systems, and developer tools. Source for
**[binarysemaphore.com](https://binarysemaphore.com)**.

Current focus: [**inode**](https://github.com/BiSemaphore), a CLI knowledge base
that retrieves notes, secrets, and commands by meaning instead of exact keywords.

## Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) 16 (App Router) + TypeScript (strict)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) v4
- MDX content pipeline for `/threads`
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) (unit) and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) (smoke)
- Deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000
```

## Scripts

| Script              | What it does               |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`       | Local dev server           |
| `npm run build`     | Production build           |
| `npm run start`     | Serve the production build |
| `npm run lint`      | ESLint                     |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit`             |
| `npm run test`      | Unit tests (Vitest)        |
| `npm run test:e2e`  | Smoke tests (Playwright)   |

## Project structure

- `src/app/` — routes (`/`, `/about`, `/services`, `/projects`, `/team`,
  `/contact`, `/threads`, plus `/projects/[slug]`, `/team/[slug]`,
  `/threads/[slug]`), `layout.tsx`, `globals.css`.
- `src/components/` — section and UI components.
- `src/lib/site.ts` — **single source of truth** for all copy, links, the team,
  and projects. Edit copy here, not in components.
- `src/content/threads/*.mdx` — long-form posts; frontmatter parsed by
  `src/lib/threads.ts`.
- `src/images/` — optimized photography (statically imported for blur-up).
- `public/tech/` — technology logos for the stack section.
- `e2e/` — Playwright smoke tests.

## Editing content

All site copy and links live in [`src/lib/site.ts`](src/lib/site.ts); components
read from it. Long-form writing lives as MDX under
[`src/content/threads`](src/content/threads).

Copy voice: plain and human, no em dashes, no marketing slogans. See
[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for the full guidelines.

## Testing

```bash
npm run test       # Vitest unit tests (lib + site config invariants)
npm run test:e2e   # Playwright smoke tests (key routes, nav, contact)
```

Unit tests live next to the code as `*.test.ts`; smoke tests live in `e2e/`.

## Backend (Supabase)

The backend is [Supabase](https://supabase.com) (hosted Postgres + Auth), called
from inside the app via `@supabase/ssr`. No separate service to host.

1. Create a Supabase project and run [`supabase/schema.sql`](supabase/schema.sql)
   in its SQL editor.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and
   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (Project Settings -> API). Add the same
   vars to the Vercel project env for production.
3. Clients live under [`src/utils/supabase/`](src/utils/supabase): `server.ts`
   (Server Components / Route Handlers / server actions), `client.ts` (browser),
   and `middleware.ts` (session refresh, wired in `src/proxy.ts` — Next 16's
   renamed middleware convention). They use the publishable key and respect
   row-level security.

Worked example: `POST /api/contact`
([`src/app/api/contact/route.ts`](src/app/api/contact/route.ts)) validates a
submission and inserts it into the `contact_messages` table.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/contact \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"Ada","email":"ada@example.com","message":"hi"}'
```

### Auth

Sign-in uses Supabase Auth with **GitHub** and **Google** OAuth. Flow: `/login`
(buttons) -> provider -> `/auth/callback` (exchanges the code for a session) ->
`/account`. Sign out posts to `/auth/signout`. Gate any page by calling
`getCurrentUser()` from [`src/utils/supabase/auth.ts`](src/utils/supabase/auth.ts)
and redirecting to `/login` when it is null (see `src/app/account/page.tsx`).

To enable the providers (one-time, in dashboards):

1. **Supabase -> Authentication -> Providers:** enable GitHub and Google and
   paste each provider's Client ID/Secret.
   - **GitHub:** create an OAuth App at
     `https://github.com/settings/developers`. Authorization callback URL:
     `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`.
   - **Google:** create an OAuth client in Google Cloud Console (APIs & Services
     -> Credentials). Authorized redirect URI: the same Supabase callback URL.
2. **Supabase -> Authentication -> URL Configuration:** set the Site URL to the
   production URL and add redirect URLs `https://binarysemaphore.com/auth/callback`
   and `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`.

## Workflow

Work on a feature branch and open a pull request; `main` is updated only by
merging a reviewed PR. Husky hooks enforce quality locally: `pre-commit` runs
lint-staged (ESLint + Prettier on staged files), `commit-msg` checks the message
against [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org)
(`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, ...), and `pre-push` runs typecheck and unit tests.

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions ([`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml)) runs
lint, typecheck, and tests on every push and pull request, then deploys via the
Vercel CLI: a preview deployment for each PR and a production deployment on
`main`. Requires the `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, and `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`
repository secrets.
